# LZ_ChangeScreenRes v1.0

## Introduction

This plugin gives the options and convencience of changing screen resolutions ingame,
while not having to worry about hard coding the resolution. Also a nice feature
if you want to test the screen resolution compatibilies in your game without
having to restart and change screen resolutions everytime. 

In total you can use up to 4 different screen resolutions. The default 
resolution, which is set in the System 2 config in MZ is selected by default. 
There is no restriction on setting the screen resolution. MZ is the limit 
however, I'm sure there are boundaries.

Note: Changing the game resolution ingame will keep the resolution on the next 
game start. Like with other audio or game options, the screen resolution is 
also saved in the config files. 

## How to use

### Example
Config A to options -> Whether or not Config A should be shown in the game options <br>
Width -> Screen width in pixels <br>
Height -> Screen height in pixels <br>

Note: 
 - Default Config is always seen in the ingame options.
 - Default screen size in System 2 settings MUST be same as in Display Config 
   default in the plugin setting. Otherwise ingame default screen size won't 
   match the screen size shown on the option button.
